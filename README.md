- 👋 Hi, I’m @Steph-The-Dev
- 👀 I’m interested in all sorts of programming and especially in computer vision related things.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the web stack to become a Full Stack Developer. (HTML, CSS, JS, React, Bootstrap, Tailwind ... the back-end part is to come later...).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on exciting projects that could make a positive impact on our world.
- 📫 How to reach me ... here or head over to my yet to build portfolio site at steph-the-dev.de
