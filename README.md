# 👋 Hi, I’m Stephan Pfeiffer!
## I'm a web developer mainly using Astro and Vue.
### I'd consider myself a problem finder and a solution seeker.
#### All AI related things fascinate me. Especially computer vision, which might come from my background as a video editor and colorist that I have been for the last sixteen years. 2022 I've started my web development journey.

- 🌱 I’m currently making my transition from freelance video editor & colorist to web developer (Typescript, Astro, Vue, React, Tailwind).
- 💞️ I’m currently on the look out for a role in web development, ideally using Javascript/Typescript and Vue.
- 📫 If you're hiring, please reach out to me. All my details are on my [portfolio site](https://www.stephthedev.de).
