# 👋 Hi, I’m Stephan Pfeiffer!
## I'm a web developer mainly using Vue and Astro.
### I'd consider myself a problem finder and a solution seeker.
#### All AI related things fascinate me. Especially computer vision, which might come from my background as a video editor and colorist that I have been for the last sixteen years. 2022 I've started my web development journey.

- 🌱 I’m currently working freelance as a web developer (Typescript, Astro, Vue, React, Tailwind).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on exciting projects that could make a positive impact on our world.
- 📫 How to reach me ... here or head over to my [portfolio site](https://www.stephthedev.de).
