## 🛰️ About Me
After two decades as a **Senior Colorist and Video Editor**, I am currently pivoting my expertise toward **Data Science**, specializing in **Computer Vision** and **Remote Sensing**. 

My background in post-production has given me a deep, intuitive understanding of image matrices, signal processing, and color space transformations. I am now focusing on applying these "visual insights" to algorithmic data analysis to solve real-world problems.

The catalyst for my transition was the **Full-Stack Development bootcamp at TechLabs** in 2022. Mastering software architecture and code (Vue, Astro, Node.js) opened the door to a more analytical path, leading me to my current deep dive into Python-driven Data Science.

- 🌍 **Mission:** Leveraging Earth Observation data to drive sustainability and "Impact AI".
- 🎓 **Education:** Dipl.-Kfm. (Business) | Full-Stack Web Development (TechLabs Alumni).
- 🛠️ **Background:** 18+ years of professional visual signal processing and high-end digital imaging.
- 🚀 **Currently Learning:** Advanced Statistics, Linear Algebra for ML, and Geospatial Data Analysis.
